#     Pig App

this is a two person game created by me and the credit of the success of this app goes to Jonas Schmedtmann.

#The rules of the game goes thus;

1. Type in the total/ or maximum score in the input box below. 
2. Two dices will be rolled immediately you clicked the "Roll Dice" button
3. If the Dice one Twice then the player loose its round and it will be Player 2 turn.
4. To avoid the loss in step 2, the Player can click on "Hold" to sum up its current score to the Global Score and it will be the next Player's turn.
